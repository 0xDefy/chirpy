# Chirpy — A Simple Go Backend for a Microblogging App

Chirpy is a backend web server built in Go that powers a basic microblogging platform similar to Twitter. It supports user authentication, chirping (posting messages), and basic user upgrades through an external webhook system.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User signup, login, password update
- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Chirp creation, listing, deletion
- Sort and filter chirps by author
- Token refresh and revocation
- Admin-only metrics and reset endpoint
- User upgrade via `Polka` webhook event
- Profanity filter for chirp body text

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Go (Golang)
- PostgreSQL
- RESTful HTTP API
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- UUIDs for ID management
- Environment configuration via `.env`
- Built-in Go HTTP server

---

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chirpy.git
cd chirpy
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file

```env
DB_URL=your_postgres_connection_url
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
POLKA_KEY=your_polka_api_key
PLATFORM=dev
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
go run main.go
```

By default, the server listens on `http://localhost:8080`.

## 📚 API Endpoints

### Health Check
- `GET /api/healthz`

### Metrics (Admin)
- `GET /admin/metrics`

### User Management
- `POST /api/users`: Register a new user
- `PUT /api/users`: Update user email/password (requires JWT)
- `POST /api/login`: Login and get JWT + refresh token
- `POST /api/refresh`: Refresh access token using refresh token
- `POST /api/revoke`: Revoke refresh token

### Chirps
- `POST /api/chirps`: Create a chirp (requires JWT)
- `GET /api/chirps`: Get all chirps (supports sorting and filtering)
- `GET /api/chirps/{chirpID}`: Get chirp by ID
- `DELETE /api/chirps/{chirpID}`: Delete a chirp (must be owner)

### Admin
- `POST /admin/reset`: Delete all users (only in `dev` mode)

### Webhooks
- `POST /api/polka/webhooks`: Handle user upgrade from Polka (requires Polka API key)

---

## 🧪 Example Curl Requests

### Register a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"test@example.com", "password":"secret"}'
```

### Post a Chirp

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chirps \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"body":"hello world"}'
```

---

## ✅ Profanity Filtering

The following words are automatically censored from chirp content:

- `kerfuffle`
- `sharbert`
- `fornax`

These are replaced with `****` in the stored message.
